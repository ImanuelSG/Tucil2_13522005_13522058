## General Information

- This project was made to fulfill our second task in Algorithm Strategies course in order to use the Divide and Conquer algorithm for practical use cases.
- This project is aimed at showing how powerful a good Divide and Conquer approach can be in terms of increasing the performance speed of one's code.
- With this project, we hope people can see more about the use cases of the Divide and Conquer approach.

## Technologies Used

- Python

## Libraries Used

- matplotlib
- time
- dataclasses

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImanuelSG/Tucil2_13522005_13522058.git
cd Tucil2_13522005_13522058
cd src
python main.py
```

## Usage

To add a test case file, please navigate to the test/input folder and provide a txt file. You will be prompted to enter the filename (example : tes1.txt)

```bash
N = Number of Control Points
x1 y1
x2 y2
xN yN
```

for example with 3 Control Points

```bash
3
1 0
2 1
4 1
```

## Room for Improvement

There are a lot of things that can be developed more from this project since this program is still relatively simple.

Room for improvement:

- Better algorithm and argument passing
- Improved animation methods

To do:

- Add better animation to make the process more visible
- Develop a better GUI for easier input (website if possible)
